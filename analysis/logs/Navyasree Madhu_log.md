**Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log**

**Week 1- Week 4** 

Number of hours: 48-50 hours

1.	Data preprocessing and feature engineering

2.	Project proposal

Rose

1.	Formed the ‘AI-Personalized Medicine team’ consisting of five members.

2.	Received project objectives and scope from the advisor, reviewed the problem statement, conducted a literature review, and performed background research.

3.	Collected datasets from RxNorm, DrugBank, and Synthea, and performed data mapping.

4.	Gained familiarity with the datasets and researched medical terminology to better understand medications, mechanisms of action, and potential side effects

In the future, we could incorporate gene expression data to better assess risk levels and potential side effects based on a patient’s health condition. By integrating each patient’s pharmacogenomic profile, age, demographic factors, and the health data the model can be trained to predict polypharmacy risk more effectively.

Thorn

1.	Data mapping proved to be both challenging and time-consuming due to the complexity of aligning information across multiple sources.

2.	Feature engineering was a time-intensive process, especially given the large volume of data we worked with.

**Week 5- Week 8**

Number of hours: 60-65 hours

Rose

1.	Selected and developed appropriate machine learning models based on project requirements.

2.	Conducted initial model training and validation using prepared datasets.

3.	Evaluated model performance through relevant metrics and validation techniques.

4.	Integrated the model into the system and developed a functional prototype.

5.	Completed full functionality testing to ensure system reliability and accuracy.

6.	Performed final model optimization.

Bud

Future perspective of this project involves an enhanced version can be developed using transformer-based BioBERT models to handle large-scale data. 

Thorn

Handling the large dataset on a local system was quite challenging, so we utilized the Jetstream platform to manage and process the data more efficiently.

**Week 9**

Number of hours: 20hours

1.	Poster demo preparation

Rose

1.	Prepared the poster for the demo session, received feedback, and submitted the final version.

2.	Developed an application using Python and Streamlit, which successfully predict the risk while consuming combination medication. 

Bud

1.	In the future, we might add Docker and Binder support to make the project more accessible.
